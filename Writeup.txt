In this project the goal was to create the Scrabble game and fully implement all of its features. In this project the players can put the letter tiles onto the board via drag and drop. Every single time a new game is created, or the game is reset a new hand of tiles are randomly selected from the available letters of the alphabet. The program identifies which letter is dropped onto which square. Tiles can only be dragged from the rack to the Scrabble board if the user drops them anywhere else they will have to bounce back to the rack or wherever it was last whether it be rack or board. Users can always restart the game, and the boys cleared after each round so that a new word can be played.
